You will find stock prices, both intra-day, and historical daily prices. If you select a company, e.g. Equinor, you will find historical daily data on the link “Dataeksport”.





Click on the link “Historikk” csv.




And you will be sent to a static web-page, updated daily with data on trades of Equinor.


Copy the url from the web-page, it should read: https://www.netfonds.no/quotes/paperhistory.php?paper=EQNR.OSE&csv_format=csv


In RStudio, import these data by using the “Import Dataset” button “From Text”:




Do the following (using the tidyverse):

Download the Equinor data.
Format the “quote_date” to a date format.

Download and process similar data from Norsk Hydro (ticker NHY).
Merge the two data frames, and make a ggplot-plot of the close price of both companies in the same plot.

It should look something like this:





Some plotting tips is found here.


Some additional “Bells & Whistles”:


Use January 4, 2010 as the starting point of the plot.
Calculate the returns (i.e., the log differential) on the price of each stock, and plot the cumulative returns.
Use January 4, 2010 as the starting point of the cumulative plot, i.e. it is equal to 100.
